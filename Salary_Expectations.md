### Salary Expectations and Potential

After researching a little on Glassdoor, Indeed and Payscale, the beginning estimated Junior Java Developer salary start around $72,000. 
This seems a little high for New Mexico but I would expect to make around $55-60,000 but would accept $72,000 with open arms.
Potential for a Senior Java Developer was estimated around $100,000 which seemed about right to me.
