## Hi, my name is Kevin.I want to help change the world by coding new porgrams that help make renewable energy more efficient. I am partnering up with a local engineering firm and coding it with the Java language. Would you like to get together for lunch and discuss it further?

 I want to be an employee at Sandia Labs in Albuquerque.

## Passion Project
My passion project started in a IT class, I had to design a website to walk people through a recipe. During the project I came to understand that instructions needed to be descriptive but not overbearing. But at the same time I was able to be creative about how to present my site. It opened my eyes about my desire to work with computers and give myself another way to be creative. It also gave me a new perspective about how much work actually goes into making a website.
