### Hi, my name is Kevin. I want to help change the world by coding new porgrams that help make renewable energy more efficient. I am partnering up with a local engineering firm and coding it with the Java language. Would you like to get together for lunch and discuss it further?

 I want to be an employee at Sandia Labs in Albuquerque.

## Passion Project
My passion project started in a IT class, I had to design a website to walk people through a recipe. During the project I came to understand that instructions needed to be descriptive but not overwhelming. But at the same time I was able to be creative about how to present my site. It opened my eyes about my desire to work with computers and give myself another outlet to be creative. It also gave me a new perspective about how much work actually goes into making a website.

## Weekly Reflections

### Week 1
After completing week one of the Java and Android Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, I realize that I have a lot to learn. It is exciting to learn the programming language and how innovative a programmer can be figuring out numerous solutions to a problem. At first the most difficult part was figuring out how to get started writing code and identifying what the question is asking. But learning how to use various loops and code it is slowly beginning to make sense; I look forward to progressing through the bootcamp.

### Week 2
I am starting to understand the concepts
