### Hi, my name is Kevin. I want to help change the world by coding new porgrams that help make renewable energy more efficient. I am partnering up with a local engineering firm and coding it with the Java language. Would you like to get together for lunch and discuss it further?

 I want to be an employee at Sandia Labs in Albuquerque.

## Passion Project
My passion project started in a IT class, I had to design a website to walk people through a recipe. During the project I came to understand that instructions needed to be descriptive but not overwhelming. But at the same time I was able to be creative about how to present my site. It opened my eyes about my desire to work with computers and give myself another outlet to be creative. It also gave me a new perspective about how much work actually goes into making a website.

If this image causes you to be confused, that is the point. My current state of my life is that of confusion. I know I am going in the correct direction but I am still lost and confused with my "coding" life. I know that it will get better but it will take time.

## Three Year From Now

This image represents my hopeful future life in three year. I imagine my life being tranquil and pleasant because I will be an established coder with more confidence and skill.


## Weekly Reflections

### Week 1
After completing week one of the Java and Android Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, I realize that I have a lot to learn. It is exciting to learn the programming language and how innovative a programmer can be figuring out numerous solutions to a problem. At first the most difficult part was figuring out how to get started writing code and identifying what the question is asking. But learning how to use various loops and code it is slowly beginning to make sense; I look forward to progressing through the bootcamp.

### Week 2
Week 2 of the coding bootcamp had it's twists and turns. I am understanding the concepts a little better and starting to understand but I still feel like I still lack the confidence to start coding on my own. I am getting some tutoring as well as watching and doing some coding in Udemy and other sites. I am sure the more I get my hands on actual coding the better I will get.

### Week 3
Week 3 of the coding bootcamp came with another roller coaster. There were numerous ups and downs that opened up more questions about coding. But, this is a good thing. The questions have been motivating me more to study when I tired. I have been lucky to have classmates that are willing to help. The presentations at the end of the week were very comforting. The theme was about exactly what I was experiencing that week about using those feeling of failure to motivate you or not letting the success trick you that you know very thing. So I practiced writing code this week to help eliminate this fear that I don't know anything. It has helped so far. But the more I do the better I feel.
